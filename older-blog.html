              <p>You are about to make that long holiday trip 
                but you don't know what to bring along on that 
                journey or probably you are someone like me that 
                makes the decision at the last minute thereby 
                putting the whole place in a mess.</p>
              <p>Here is a few checklist that will ensure you 
                have the essential needs packed in that suitcase 
                or travelbag.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Double-check your boarding passes and itinerary</li>
                    <p>Don't be like Uncle A that got to the check-in point 
                        at the airport and found out his travel schedule which 
                        was suppose to be June 12 at 7:00am was actually 
                        booked for July 12 at 7:00am</p>

                    <li>Keep your travel documents safe</li>
                    <p>You don't want to be searching for this important requirement 
                        a day before you travel, so its best you keep it where you can 
                        easily see it.</p>
                    
                    <li>Check your prescriptions</li>
                    <p>Travelling especially on a long journey can actually be 
                        strenous and can really tell on your health, so its best 
                        to have your prescriptions handy for your entire trip.</p>

                    <li>Purchase a travel insurance if you haven't done so</li>
                    <p>Purchasing a travel insurance can be done prior to your travel day 
                        and its advisable you purchase in advance to enjoy the plan that 
                        includes valuable trip cancellation, trip interruptiion benefits 
                        and benefits for pre-existing medical conditions on your trip</p>

                    <li>Charge all your electronics</li>
                    <p>Don't get caught up in the queue to get your device on at the airport charging station.
                        That call might really be needed to save the day. </p>
                    
                     <li>Schedule a ride to the airport if necessary</li>
                     <p>Getting through the street hassels in order to get to the airport on time can really be 
                        avoided if you schedule a ride to take you through it quick and smooth.</p>   
                </ol>                
                <p>As long as you have all your things properly arranged, you can be sure of a hitch free journey. 
                    Enjoy every bit of your trip.</p>
